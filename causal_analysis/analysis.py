    # Sensitivity analysis helps us study how robust an estimated effect is when the assumption of no unobserved confounding is violated. That is, how much bias does our estimate have due to omitting an (unobserved) confounder? Known as the omitted variable bias (OVB), it gives us a measure of how the inclusion of an omitted common cause (confounder) would have changed the estimated effect.
    # **Information in the plot**: 
    # a. The x-axis shows hypothetical partial R2 values of unobserved confounder(s) with the treatment. The y-axis shows hypothetical partial R2 of unobserved confounder(s) with the outcome. 
    # b. At <x=0,y=0>, the black diamond shows the original estimate (theta_s) without considering the unobserved confounders.
    # c. The contour levels represent adjusted estimate of the effect, which would be obtained if the unobserved confounder(s) had been included in the estimation model. 
    # d. The red contour line is the critical threshold where the adjusted effect goes to zero. Thus, confounders with such strength or stronger are sufficient to reverse the sign of the estimated effect and invalidate the estimate’s conclusions. 
    # e. The red triangle shows the estimated effect when the unobserved covariate has 1 or 2 or 3 times partial-R^2 of a chosen benchmark observed covariate with the outcome.

    **Methods to calculate Anormaly Attribution Score**
    We estimated the contribution of the ancestors of {key_node}, including {key_node} itself, to the observed anomaly.
    In this method, we use invertible causal mechanisms to reconstruct and modify the noise leading to a certain observation. We then ask, “If the noise value of a specific node was from its ‘normal’ distribution, would we still have observed an anomalous value in the target node?”. The change in the severity of the anomaly in the target node after altering an upstream noise variable’s value, based on its learned distribution, indicates the node’s contribution to the anomaly. The advantage of using the noise value over the actual node value is that we measure only the influence originating from the node and not inherited from its parents.
