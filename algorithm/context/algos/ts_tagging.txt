# Causal Discovery Algorithm Tagging for Time Series

## CRITICAL: Performance Ratings Are Conditional
⚠️ **All performance ratings assume appropriate data property matching**
⚠️ **An algorithm with "Strong" rating will perform POORLY on mismatched data**
⚠️ **Data property alignment MUST take precedence over performance ratings**

## Selection Priority (VARIES BY PROBLEM SCALE)

### For Small to Medium-Scale Problems (< 50 variables)
1. Graph density match (Sparse/Dense)
2. Functional form match (Linear/Nonlinear)
3. Noise assumptions match (Gaussian/NonGaussian)
4. Empirical performance (only after matches verified)
5. Efficiency/Scalability

### For Large-Scale Problems (≥ 50 variables)
1. Scalability/Efficiency (must be able to complete in reasonable time)
2. Graph density match (Sparse/Dense)
3. Functional form match (Linear/Nonlinear)
4. Noise assumptions match (Gaussian/NonGaussian)
5. Empirical performance (only after all above verified)

### For Very Large-Scale Problems (≥ 100 variables)
1. Scalability (must support target variable count)
2. Efficiency (runtime must be feasible with available resources)
3. Graph density match (if algorithm can handle the scale)
4. Other compatibility factors (as feasible)

## Performance Categories
- **Robust**: ≥80% accuracy with matched data properties
- **Strong**: 60-80% accuracy with matched data properties
- **Moderate**: 40-60% accuracy with matched data properties

- **Poor**: Unreliable even with matched data properties
