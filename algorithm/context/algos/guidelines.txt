## Domain Knowledge about Algorithm Selection

Based on the characteristics of your data and requirements, consider the following priority order for selecting causal discovery algorithms:

1. If your data is nonstationary or heterogeneous across domains/time:
   - Use CDNOD as the first choice
   - Note that DO NOT use it if your data is not heterogeneous or nonstationary
   
2. If your data is linear or you prefer a score-based approach and assume no hidden confounders:
   - Consider GES (Greedy Equivalence Search)
   
3. If the noise is non-Gaussian and you believe the relationships are linear:
   - Try DirectLiNGAM first
   - If computational resources allow, also consider ICALiNGAM
   - Note that DO NOT use them if there are non-linear relations in your data.

4. If you have a large dataset with all relevant variables observed:
   - Start with PC algorithm
   
5. If your data is high-dimensional and you prefer a continuous optimization approach:
   - Experiment with NOTEARS
   
6. If you suspect the presence of hidden confounders:
   - Try FCI as the primary algorithm

Additional considerations:

- For large datasets where efficiency is crucial, prioritize PC or GES
- If you need a fully directed graph rather than a Markov equivalence class, prefer LiNGAM variants or NOTEARS
- When dealing with non-linear relationships, consider extensions of these algorithms designed for non-linear data

Default algorithm ranking for general cases (when data doesn't favor any specific characteristics):

1. PC: Good balance between generality and computational efficiency
2. GES: Efficient for larger datasets and provides a good general approach
3. FCI: More general than PC but computationally more intensive
4. NOTEARS: Efficient for high-dimensional data but assumes linear relationships
5. DirectLiNGAM: Efficient but assumes linear relationships and non-Gaussian noise
6. ICALiNGAM: More computationally intensive than DirectLiNGAM
7. CDNOD: Specialized for nonstationary/heterogeneous data, may be overkill for stationary data
