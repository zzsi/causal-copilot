Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
   - Data Type: [DATA_TYPE]
   - Missingness: [MISSINGNESS]
   - Linearity: [LINEARITY]
   - Gaussian Error: [GAUSSIAN_ERROR]
   - Stationary: [STATIONARY]

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and recommend suitable causal discovery algorithms. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

Algorithms:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

For each recommended algorithm, provide:
1. Algorithm name (name of the available algorithm in the implementation)
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics

Present your recommendations in a structured JSON format, focusing on the most suitable algorithms given the dataset characteristics. Limit your recommendations to the top 3 most suitable algorithms.

Please structure your response like this example:

{
  "algorithms": [
    {
      "name": "Algorithm Name",
      "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.",
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",
    },
    {
      "name": "Another Algorithm Name",
      "description": "Brief description of another algorithm.",
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is also suitable.",
    },
    {
      "name": "Third Algorithm Name",
      "description": "Brief description of a third algorithm.",
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is also suitable.",
    }
  ]
}

Please provide your recommendations following this JSON structure.
