### **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**

- **Description**: BIC evaluates the likelihood of the data given a model, with a penalty for the number of parameters. It balances fit with model complexity to avoid overfitting.
- **Advantages**:
    - Penalizes complex models, promoting simplicity.
    - Efficient for Gaussian data.
- **Limitations**:
    - Assumes linearity and Gaussian distribution, limiting its use for non-Gaussian data.

### **BDeu (Bayesian Dirichlet Equivalent Uniform)**

- **Description**: BDeu is a Bayesian score for discrete data that measures model fit by integrating over all possible parameter values. It assumes a Dirichlet prior distribution with uniform parameters.
- **Advantages**:
    - Effective for discrete data.
    - Avoids overfitting by integrating over parameter uncertainty.
- **Limitations**:
    - Can be sensitive to the choice of prior parameters.
- **Suitable Cases**:
    - Discrete data with categorical variables.

### Generalized Score Functions

- **Description:** Generalized score functions utilize nonparametric methods, such as regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), to capture dependencies between variables without assuming specific functional forms. This allows the algorithm to accommodate a wider range of data types and relationships.
- **Advantages**:
    - **Flexibility**: Unlike traditional score functions that rely on specific parametric assumptions, generalized score functions can handle a variety of data distributions and causal structures, including those that are nonlinear and non-Gaussian.
    - **Robustness**: The method is robust to different data characteristics, such as mixed data types and multi-dimensional variables, making it applicable across different domains.
- **Limitations**:
    - **Computational Cost**: The flexibility and generality come with increased computational demands, particularly when applying nonparametric methods like those based on RKHS. This can be a limiting factor for very large datasets.
    - **Complexity in Implementation**: The implementation of generalized score functions requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as those governing the kernel methods.
- **Suitable Cases**:
    - **Non-Gaussian and Non-linear Data**: When dealing with datasets that do not follow Gaussian distributions or involve non-linear causal relationships, generalized score functions provide a robust alternative to traditional scores.
    - **High-dimensional and Mixed-type Data**: For datasets with complex structures, including multi-dimensional variables and mixed continuous-discrete data, generalized score functions are well-suited to uncovering the underlying causal relationships.
