## Introduction
Understanding causal relationships is fundamental to scientific discovery, enabling researchers to move beyond mere correlation and establish the underlying mechanisms that drive natural and social phenomena. Recent years have witnessed significant theoretical advancements in causal discovery, yielding a diverse array of sophisticated methodologies. However, the complexity of these methods—each with its distinct assumptions, applicability conditions, and technical nuances—has created substantial barriers for scientists outside the field of causal analysis, often deterring them from adopting these powerful analytical tools in their research.

Causal-Copilot is a LLM-oriented toolkit for **automatic causal analysis** that uniquely integrates domain knowledge from large language models with established expertise from causal discovery researchers. Designed for scientific researchers and data scientists, it facilitates the identification, analysis, and interpretation of causal relationships within real-world datasets through natural dialogue. The system autonomously orchestrates the entire analytical pipeline-analyzing statistics, selecting optimal causal analysis algorithms, configuring appropriate hyperparameters, synthesizing executable code, conducting uncertainty quantification, and generating comprehensive PDF reports—while requiring minimal expertise in causal methods. This seamless integration of conversational interaction and rigorous methodology culminates enables researchers across disciplines to focus on domain-specific insights rather than technical implementation details.

## Features

- **Automated Causal Analysis**: Harnesses the power of large language models combined with domain expertise to select optimal causal analysis algorithms and hyperparameters. Incorporates proven methodological insights from causal discovery researchers to ensure the analytical reliability, without the requirements in expertise about causality and extensive parameter tuning. 
- **Statistical-LLM Hybrid Post Processing**: Present the edge uncertainty examination (bootstrap), as well as graph pruning and direction revision driven by LLM's prior knowledge.
- **Chat-based User-friendly Interface**: Navigate complex causal analysis through natural dialogue, and visualize data statistics and causal graphs through clear, intuitive figures, without wrestling with technical details. 
- **Comprehensive Analysis Report**: Provide well-formulated scientific report for the whole causal analysis process, containing detailed explanation documenting the complete analytical process, intuitive visualization and in-depth interpretation of the findings.
- **Extensibility**: Maintain open interfaces for integrating new causal analysis algorithms and support seamless incorporation of emerging causality-related libraries and methodologies

### Architecture Details

- **Causal‑Copilot** adopts a modular architecture built around five primary components—**Simulation, User Interaction, Preprocessing, Algorithm Selection,** and **Postprocessing**—that together deliver an end‑to‑end causal analysis pipeline. A large language model (LLM) sits at the core of the framework, coordinating data flow among these modules while tapping into auxiliary resources such as a causality‑focused knowledge base and a library of local algorithms. All modules communicate via unified interfaces that pass structured metadata and intermediate results, allowing the LLM to supervise execution seamlessly. This organization preserves clear separation of concerns, simplifies extension, and makes it straightforward to integrate new capabilities into the system.

### Architecture Details

- Our Causal-Copilot consists of four components, namely preprocessing, decision making, post processing and intepretation parts, which are all supported by SOTA LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).

### Evaluation on Simulated Data

- We evaluate the automatic causal discovery ability of our Causal-Copilot on in total 180 simulated datasets including different types of functional forms, graph sparsity, noise types and heterogeneity, compared with a robust baseline, PC algorithm with the default setting.
- The results show that our Causal-Copilot can achieve much better performance, indicating the effectiveness of its automatic algorithm selection and hyper-parameter setting strategy, in a autonomous manner.

| Metric    | Baseline | Causal-Copilot |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Precision | 78.6%    | **81.6%**      |
| Recall    | 78.2%    | **81.0%**      |
| F1-score  | 76.1%    | **79.3%**      |

### Local Deployment

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required Python libraries (specified in `setup/requirements_cpu.txt` and `setup/requirements_gpu.txt`)
- Required LaTeX packages (`tinyTex`)

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by choosing the appropriate dependencies (CPU/GPU + Tex):

#### CPU Dependencies

If you don't have a Nvidia GPU, you can't use the GPU accelerated algorithms (e.g. AcceleratedLiNGAM). You can use the CPU version by running:

```bash
pip install -r setup/requirements_cpu.txt --no-deps
```

#### GPU Dependencies

If you have a Nvidia GPU, you can use the GPU accelerated algorithms by running:

```bash
pip install -r setup/requirements_gpu.txt --no-deps
```


### Tex Dependencies

Install the `tinyTex` package to generate PDF reports:

For Mac:

```
$ rm -rf ~/Library/TinyTeX
$ wget -qO- "https://yihui.org/tinytex/install-bin-unix.sh" | sh
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/universal-darwin" 
$ source ~/.zshrc

$ tlmgr update --self
$ tlmgr install fancyhdr caption subcaption nicefrac microtype lipsum graphics natbib doi

```

For Linux:

```
$ rm -rf ~/.TinyTeX
$ wget -qO- "https://yihui.org/tinytex/install-bin-unix.sh" | sh
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux"
$ source ~/.bashrc
